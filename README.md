# AI-ML-Applications-on-Gadi_Astronomy

There are 2 parts and notebooks in this session. We will be using `part1_emulator.ipynb` and `part2_inference.ipynb` to demonstrate how one can use neural networks to emulate a complex model and how to use the emulator in Bayesian inference. The folder, `answers`, contains the same 2 notebooks with all blocks filled. It also has another notebook and corresponding python script for running a nested sampler, as well as the slides (no animation) used during the demonstration.
